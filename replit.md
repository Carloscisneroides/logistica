## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React 18 with Vite and TypeScript, styled with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive interface. Wouter handles client-side routing, and Lucide Icons provide visual elements.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Wouter, TanStack Query for state management, React Hook Form with Zod for forms, Playwright for E2E testing, and 10-language internationalization.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions.
- **Authentication**: Session-based with multi-tenant isolation, role-based access control, and OWASP compliant security.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API is used for contextual AI assistance, intelligent routing, and pattern detection within the anti-fraud system.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with a multi-tenant optimized schema, over 45 tables across core modules, Drizzle ORM for type safety and auto-migrations, comprehensive audit logging, and automated backups. A dedicated anti-fraud database is implemented for pattern detection and risk scoring.

### Feature Specifications

**OPERATIONAL MODULES (âœ… Ready):**
- **Core Platform**: Dashboard, authentication, security
- **Logistica & Spedizioni**: 7 active modules (routing, tracking, rates, customs, returns)
- **eCommerce**: Storefront, anti-fraud checkout, loyalty system
- **Sistema Amministrativo**: Documents, contracts, invoices, SRL registry
- **Role-based Interfaces**: 5 areas (merchant, operator, partner, sub-client, admin)
- **Sistema AI**: Contextual assistant, predictive anti-fraud
- **PWA Mobile**: Refactored UI, category access, unified registration

**IN CONSOLIDATION (ðŸ”§ Refinement Phase):**
- **Global Enterprise Module**: Maritime/Air fleet management perfection
- **Clienti & CRM**: Client management, anti-fraud profiling refinement
- **Finanziario**: Billing, payments, Stripe testing phase
- **Marketplace Digitale**: 90% complete + planned Glovo model integration
- **Commerciale**: AI offers, coupons, upselling refinement
- **Espansione Internazionale**: 4 modules in rollout (localization, compliance, partner APIs, distribution)

**MULTILINGUA & PERSONALIZATION:**
